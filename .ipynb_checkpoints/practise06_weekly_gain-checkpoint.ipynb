    "Student Activity: Weekly Gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script showcases how to use nested list/dict objects to\n",
    "calculate weekly gains of stock tickers.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Weekly Gains\n",
    "In this activity, you will work with nested data structures by storing daily stock data in a list, \n",
    "and then storing that list in a dictionary. You will then retrieve stock data from the dictionary \n",
    "for specific days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background\n",
    "The stock markets have been closed since 4:00 p.m., and now it's almost 5:00 p.m. on Friday. \n",
    "As his job entails, Harold needs to close out another week of gathering stock data in order to calculate a report of the weekly gains of his list of stocks.\n",
    "Harold usually performs this task by manually looking up the stock price records for the new day, \n",
    "adding them to his weekly list of stocks, and then running his calculations. \n",
    "However, he now wonders if there is a quicker way to do all of this so that he can go home earlier on Fridays.\n",
    "Help Harold by creating a program to automate his data gathering process and weekly gains calculations.\n",
